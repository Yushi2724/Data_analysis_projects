Effectively present findings and your own conclusions/recommendations to stakeholders of various backgrounds. Requires the ability to aggregate and simplify results into memorable “take home” messages.
Develop standardized analysis methods and visualization dashboards for certain commonly structured datasets as well as bespoke methods for unique datasets
Define study endpoints, hypotheses and data analysis methods for human clinical trials.
Participate in R&D initiatives to utilize time series data sets from multiple medical devices in the development of decision support algorithms for people with diabetes
Assist system engineers in system-level characterization/verification of complex systems.
Communicate effectively with and participate on cross functional development teams with good negotiating skills to direct multi-disciplinary teams toward solutions.
Responsible for utilizing and maintaining the effectiveness of the quality system.
Responsible for compliance with applicable Corporate and Divisional Policies and performing other duties as assigned by management.

OPCS Context

Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS) plays a pivotal role in achieving the World Bank Group's mission. OPCS assists frontline staff in delivering results to clients through sound operations policy and strong country support. In the World Bank Group structure, OPCS is at the center of operations and delivery, and serves as the link between the Global Practices and the Regions. OPCS develops and oversees the Bank's operational policies for country strategies, lending operations, advisory services and analytical support, financial management, procurement, and environmental and social safeguards. It also oversees the Bank Group's Corporate Scorecard; manages interactions with the Bank's oversight units; and co-leads the results measurement and evaluation stream in the Bank Group. OPCS teams provide advice and support to World Bank management and staff as well as hands-¬on assistance to help teams leverage the Bank's policies, processes, and risk management tools for our country clients. Working in OPCS helps World Bank professionals gain broad exposure to strategic operations issues and develop a deeper understanding of the Bank's business. Some of the major initiatives OPCS is currently working on include: simplifying processes and procedures to help clients get faster results; implementing the new country engagement model and new operations risk framework; reforming environmental and social safeguards; implementing the new procurement framework; and measuring client feedback and progress towards the Bank Group's goals. OPCS is organized into the Front Office and four departments:

The Front Office (OPSFO) focuses on supporting the OPCS Vice President (VP) in the management of the operations complex and the delivery of key corporate policy commitments and reforms;
Operations Standards, Procurement, Financial Management (OPSPF) is responsible for safeguards, procurement, financial management and anti-corruption policies and support to operations;
Operations Policy (OPSPO) consolidates the corporate support and oversight of country strategies and all financing and advisory instruments as well as managing the Operations Committee and the Operations Help Desk;
Operations Strategy, Risk, Results and Learning (OPSRL) focuses on WB strategy; risk management in operations, strengthening results and effectiveness throughout the institution, including the Corporate Scorecard; support to the country directors’ and management communities; and operational learning; and
Operations Standards, Environment and Social (OPSES) is responsible for the Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) and Safeguard Policies, including support to operations, learning and training, knowledge management, reporting, interface with the Inspection Panel, and management of the Grievance Redress Service (GRS).

The Strategy, Results and Risk Unit (OPSSR), within OPSRL, encompasses four interlinked streams of work (i) it supports the OPSVP and the MDs to report on results spearheaded by Practice Groups and Regions, including through yearly Board updates on the WBGs Corporate Scorecards, and stewardship of the IDA Results Measurement System and policy commitments; (ii) it coordinates the overall engagement with the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG), including by crafting corporate responses to independent evaluations and reporting annually on the Management Action Record; (iii) it works with task teams and other units in OPCS and across GPs and Regions to support operations through relevant advice and strengthen skills, guidance, and tools to enhance Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) underpinning results reporting.; and (iv) it spearheads WBG efforts towards greater outcome orientation, including external coordination on results with other Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs).

OPSRS is currently strengthening its capacity on data science / analytics to support different aspects of OPCS’ work. This position in OPSRS will play a pivotal role in the data science work of the Unit working along with other colleagues in the team and across various Practice Groups (PGs) and Regions of the World Bank. The data scientist will work with others within OPSRS who currently support the existing data architecture.

"Data Scientist, Autonomous Vehicle Infrastructure Analytics",$168K – $322K/yr (Employer est.),"One way to picture building autonomous vehicles is that autonomy is the product of a factory. That factory consists of multiple production lines: collecting and labeling datasets, training neural networks, testing the vehicle itself, and so forth. The AV Infrastructure Team within NVIDIA’s autonomous vehicles (AV) program are the factory builders. We are looking for an experienced Data Scientist to join our AV Infra Analytics Team to help understand those production lines, optimize them, and ultimately improve the performance of the factory itself so that NVIDIA can ship outstanding autonomy on an ambitious timeline.
What You'll Be Doing:
Our team supports multiple areas - data ingestion, drive data quality, labeling and dataset generation, and many others. Your focus will be to own one or more of these areas, working with the associated engineering and product teams, and create metrics that represent the user experience.
At the same time, we also make it easier for users to answer their own questions. That requires understanding their needs deeply and how the data we have available can help. You'll use those insights to develop ETL pipelines and shared services while working to fill instrumentation gaps to create a clearer picture.
To do that well, you'll need to be comfortable up and down the analytics stack - connecting to data, cleaning it, writing your own ETL pipelines, and building dashboards in a variety of tools. Our work is very hands-on!
Your work will undoubtedly be viewed regularly by senior leaders and be used to make decisions about how time and engineering resources get spent as we work hard to nurture a culture of data-driven decision making. Knowledge and credibility are key to making that happen.
What We Need to See:
